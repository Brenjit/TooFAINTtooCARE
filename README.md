# ðŸ§  Random Stuff

This repo is my dumping ground for whatever code I'm messing around with â€” plotting, quick simulations, small scripts, half-baked ideas, etc.

No structure. No rules. Just code.

### Might include:
- Random Python scripts
- Matplotlib/Seaborn plots
- Quick tests or ideas that came at 2 AM
- Stuff I don't want to lose ðŸ˜…

Feel free to look around, but don't expect polished code here.
